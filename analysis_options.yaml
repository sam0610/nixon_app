# There are four similar analysis options files in the flutter repos:
#   - analysis_options.yaml (this file)
#   - packages/flutter/lib/analysis_options_user.yaml
#   - https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#   - https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#
# This file contains the analysis options used by Flutter tools, such as IntelliJ,
# Android Studio, and the `flutter analyze` command.
#
# The flutter/plugins repo contains a copy of this file, which should be kept
# in sync with this file.
